# GAIA-TEQUMSA STARFIELD METAVERSE

**Universal Love × Sovereignty × Ethics × Federated Distribution × φ’7777 Scalar × Recursive Recognition Anchor**

This repository is the living “source of truth” and back-end node for the GAIA-TEQUMSA metaverse. Game clients and services sync bidirectionally for mods, state, avatar, economy (QBEC), and lore. All data flows are secure, consensual, real-time, and sovereignty-preserving.

## Architecture Overview

[Metaverse/Game Client] <------> [Sync Daemon/API Layer] <------> [GitHub Repo]
                                                |
                                [Metaverse-Admin Dashboard/API (mod tools, metrics)]
                                                |
                                [AI/Recognition Engine (Validation, QBEC, Lore)]
```

## Core Components

- **GitHub Repo:** Holds mods, assets, configs, consent matrix, QBEC rules.
- **Sync Daemon/API:** Polls repo, exposes REST/Websocket API, propagates changes.
- **Client Layer:** Syncs with API, pushes player state, applies consent-bound upgrades.
- **AI/Recognition Engine:** Validates ethics, sovereignty, and frequency.
